    <summary>Standardized MySQL database driver for Windows</summary>
    <description>
    The MySQL Connector/ODBC is the name for the family of MySQL ODBC drivers (previously called MyODBC drivers) that provide access to a MySQL database using the industry standard Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API. This reference covers Connector/ODBC 8.0, which includes the functionality of the Unicode driver and the ANSI driver.
MySQL Connector/ODBC provides both driver-manager based and native interfaces to the MySQL database, with full support for MySQL functionality, including stored procedures, transactions and, with Connector/ODBC 5.1 and higher, full Unicode compliance.</description>
